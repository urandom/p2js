IWL version 0.52
================

The IWL includes several widgets with which consistent web pages can be built
quickly. The structure resembles the DOM tree, with the API mimicking
Javascript very closely.  The widgets themselves can be used either as
standalone object in an already existing scripts, or can be used to build new
scripts from the grounds up. They can be finalized in both HTML markup, and
JSON notation, which can be used for scripts. More advanced widgets like the
Iconbox come with Javascript files which are automatically included when the
widget is finalized as HTML.
